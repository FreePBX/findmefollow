		*2.4.12.3* #2057 don't strip CID prefix if no prefix is being added

		*2.4.12* Fixed bug where nested CID prefixes ends up removing part of the valid CID info
		*2.4.11.1* Fixed ALERT_INFO bug, if previously set it should not set - it was clearing it
		*2.4.11* added option to have follow-me always be used in place of extension, or only when explicitly used as a destination, useful in conjunction with VmX

		*2.4.6* Added BLKVM DB tree to fix inability to transfer a received call to another user, and make NODEST stuff work overall
		*2.4.5* Modified NODEST stuff to improve some cases where it was still failing, and improve '#' transfer scenarios
		*2.4.4* Add NODEST so that destination (often vm) is not taken if called from queue or ringgroup
		*2.4.3* Sanity check for prefing that if not set or there, it won't ring the extension forever (should not happen)

	<description>
		Much like a ring group, but works on individual extensions. When someone calls the extension, it can be setup to ring for a number of seconds before trying to ring other extensions and/or external numbers, or to ring all at once, or in other various 'hunt' configurations. Most commonly used to ring someone's cell phone if they don't answer their extension.
